# Task: task-0066

**Title:** Refactor long function: \\?\C:\Users\yuuji\Sanyuu2Kouku\SekouTaiseiMaker\react-app\src\components\AiChecker.tsx:24 (AiChecker) - 231 lines

**Priority:** P3 (Medium)

**Category:** Refactoring

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium

## Files to Modify

- `\\?\C`

## Description

This function is too long and should be broken down into smaller, focused functions.

Location: `\\?\C:\Users\yuuji\Sanyuu2Kouku\SekouTaiseiMaker\react-app\src\components\AiChecker.tsx:24 (AiChecker) - 231 lines`

## Context

Long functions are harder to maintain, test, and understand. Breaking them into smaller functions improves code quality.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Function is split into logical smaller functions
- [ ] Each new function has a single responsibility
- [ ] Existing functionality is preserved
- [ ] New functions have appropriate names

## Hints

- Identify logical blocks within the function
- Look for repeated code that can be extracted
- Consider if helper functions would improve readability
