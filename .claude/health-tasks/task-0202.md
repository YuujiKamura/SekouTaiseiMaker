# Task: task-0202

**Title:** Reduce nesting in: \\?\C:\Users\yuuji\Sanyuu2Kouku\SekouTaiseiMaker\src\views\spreadsheet_viewer.rs:36 (extract_spreadsheet_id) - 5 levels

**Priority:** P3 (Medium)

**Category:** Refactoring

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium

## Files to Modify

- `\\?\C`

## Description

This function has deep nesting that should be flattened.

Location: `\\?\C:\Users\yuuji\Sanyuu2Kouku\SekouTaiseiMaker\src\views\spreadsheet_viewer.rs:36 (extract_spreadsheet_id) - 5 levels`

## Context

Deeply nested code is hard to follow and prone to bugs. Reducing nesting improves readability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Nesting depth is reduced to 4 levels or less
- [ ] Early returns are used where appropriate
- [ ] Logic is clear and easy to follow

## Hints

- Use early returns to handle edge cases first
- Consider guard clauses
- Extract nested blocks into separate functions
